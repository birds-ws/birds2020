                                In the emerging technological and social-technical environment, people will be (to some extent, already are) constantly and ubiquitously emerged in a sea of information (or, data). This will be
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Information (data) of a great variety of “kinds”;</li>
                                    <li>Information (data) from or about increasingly varied and numerous sources;</li>
                                    <li>Information (data) in increasingly varied and numerous media types;</li>
                                    <li>Information (data) available in increasingly varied and numerous modalities; and,</li>
                                    <li>Information (data) available for access and interaction in increasingly varied and numerous contexts.</li>
                                </ul>
                                And, increasingly, “pushed” information will compete with, indeed, replace “pulled” information. All of these conditions have major implications for research and practice in each of the fields of Information Science, Information Retrieval, and Data Science, individually, in their interactions with one another, and, perhaps most importantly, in their integration. These implications present both challenges and opportunities with respect to the goal of supporting people’s interactions with information (data). In this presentation, I propose the concept of “radical personalization” as a means to support effective interaction amongst IS, IR and DS and to address these challenges and to take advantage of these opportunities. I also discuss some ethical issues inherent in supporting people’s interactions with information (data) in the era of information ubiquity in general, and in this specific approach to that goal.

                                Nicholas Belkin is Distinguished Professor of Information Science Emeritus, at the Department of Library & Information Science, Rutgers University, and Adjunct Professor at the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology. Previous to these appointments, he was Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in the Department of Information Science, The City University, London. He has held visiting positions at the University of Western Ontario, the Free University, Berlin, and the Institute for Systems Science, National University of Singapore. Professor Belkin was a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Tampere in 1996, and a Fulbright Senior Scholar in Croatia in 2003. He received his Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of London (University College).
                                <br/><br/>
                                Professor Belkin has served as the Chair of the ACM SIGIR, and President of the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIST). He is the recipient of the ASIST’s Outstanding Teacher award, its Research Award, and its Award of Merit, for outstanding contributions to Information Science. He is one of the founders of the “cognitive viewpoint” in information science, and is the co-author of one the first books to explicitly investigate and describe the process of interactive information retrieval. He is the author or co-author of over 200 journal articles, conference proceedings and book chapters, and has been identified variously as the first or second most highly cited scholar in Library and Information Science.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Professor Belkin has conducted ethnographic, sociological, behavioral and experimental research, including twelve years in the TREC Interactive Track. His most recent projects have focused on personalization of interaction with information, in particular, personalization of information retrieval based on searchers’ current and past behaviors, and on methods for evaluation of whole-session search. Professor Belkin’s research has been supported by many agencies, including NSF, Institute of Museum and Library Development Department NIST, US Department of Education, the British Library Research and Development Department, and NATO.

                                Ranking in Information Retrieval (IR) has been traditionally evaluated from the perspective of the relevance of search engine results to people searching for information, i.e., the extent to which the system provides "the right information, to the right people, in the right way, at the right time." However, people in current IR systems are not only the ones issuing search queries, but increasingly they are also the ones being searched. This raises several new problems in IR that have been addressed in recent research, particularly with respect to fairness/non-discrimination, accountability, and transparency.

                        We will be running a workshop called BIRDS - Bridging the Gap between Information Science, Information Retrieval and Data Science - which aims to foster the cross-fertilization of Information Science (IS), Information Retrieval (IR) and Data Science (DS). Recognising the commonalities and differences between these communities, the full-day workshop will bring together experts and researchers in IS, IR and DS to discuss how they can learn from each other to provide more user-driven data and information exploration and retrieval solutions. Therefore, we welcome submissions conveying interdisciplinary ideas on how to utilise, for instance, IS concepts and theories in IR and/or DS approaches to support users in data and information access. BIRDS will be collocated with the <a href="https://sigir.org/sigir2020/">43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2020)</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an">Xi'an, China</a>. The workshop will be held fully online all day on Thursday 30th July 2020.

                        We are pleased to announce Salton-award winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_J._Belkin">Nick Belkin</a> and <a href="https://chato.cl">Carlos Castillo</a> have agreed to provide keynote talks at the workshop. We are also pleased to have further invited talks by <a href="https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/guidotti-riccardo">Riccardo Guidotti</a> and <a href="https://cci.uncc.edu/directory/xi-sunshine-niu">Xi (Sunshine) Niu</a>.

                    <p class="text-dark-75 mb-4">
                        The overarching theme of the BIRDS workshop is to look at how Data Science (DS), Information Retrieval (IR) and Information Science (IS) can complement each other by applying a more holistic approach to these disciplines that go beyond traditional DS or IR or IS alone.                 <img src="assets/img/DS-IS.png" width="450px" style="float:right;padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;" alt="Data Science, Information Retrieval and Information Science"/> BIRDS aims at extending the scope of current research to provide a view on data and information in all its quantity and variety through investigating user preferences and interaction. The cross-fertilization of DS, IR and IS that we want to address in this workshop goes three ways. BIRDS will focus on the utilization of DS methodologies in IR and IS, e.g. by integrating data mining, database concepts, heterogeneous data, data analysis, exploration and visualization techniques to IR and IS. In addition, we will look at how user-oriented concepts and theories from IS, for instance, human-centric information seeking & searching, cognitive models (such as Information Foraging Theory or the Principle of Polyrepresentation), etc, can be applied to enhance and complement the data-driven approaches in DS and IR. Finally, we will also examine how IR models and theory can apply to IS and DS, e.g. by introducing the concepts of vagueness and uncertainty, inherent in many IR models, to DS and IS.
                        <br/><br/>
